                    The purpose of this page is to allow players to submit the stats of combat items that exist within
                    the world

                    In OldSchool RuneScape, there are three different types of combat styles. Melee, Range, and Magic.
                    For each
                    of these styles, there are a plethora of different weapons.
                </p>
                <p class="item_text">
                    All weapons have equipment stats, attack bonuses and defence bonuses in stab, slash, and crush melee
                    combat,
                    Ranged combat and Magic combat.
                    Each also has a melee strength, Ranged strength, and Magic strength increasing maximum damage with
                    that
                    damage type and Prayer bonus that reduces the rate at which prayers drain points.
                    Weapons also have an attack speed, which is the rate at which it attacks and an attack range. Melee
                    weapons,
                    except for halberds, all have 1 attack range. Ranged and Magic weapons vary, however most magic
                    weapons cast
                    spells from 10 tiles away.
                </p>
                <p class="item_text">
                    Some weapons also have a special attack, which is a unique attack that can be used. Special attacks
                    vary in
                    effect, but most are either a damage boost or a special effect.
                    Special attacks can be used by navigating to the special attack bar and clicking it.
